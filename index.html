            <p>Connor Thomas is a web development student at Houston Coding Bootcamp. He was born and raised in Houston TX and
                somehow never got tried of the year around one hundred percent humidity. He first became interested in web
                development after his older brother showed him the dev tools in Google Chrome when he was younger. He realized
                that with only a few lines of code and an understanding of what was possible, he could make anything he wanted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>When Connor is not writing code, he is often prepping to DM a weekly game of Dungeons & Dragons for his friends.
                Some of his other hobbies include: graphic design, cycling, and reading. </p>
